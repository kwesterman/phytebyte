1. Imeplement Phenotype2GeneTargetInput
 -- OMIM (NCBI) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man)
 -- GWAS Catalog (EBI) (50,000 rows)
2. Implement model_training graphing module (use functions in chemogenomics)
3. Need a module to handle preprocessing food_cmpds (like in bioactive_cmpds)
4. Implement phytebyte.py -> PhyteByte._load_config()
5. Multi-processing on Deserializing FoodCmpds
# Kenny...
5. Compound -> Cmpd
6. Handle compounds that share a same SMiLES (we may care about the assay data on each!)
7. !! Ensure uniqueness on positive_compounds
8. Functionality to facilitate querying metadata on compounds, and just passing around SMiLES (especially for FoodCmpd)
